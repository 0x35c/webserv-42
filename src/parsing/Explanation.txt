## "..." = commentary, ignore by parsing

server { = declare a new server block, there may be serveral

----BLOCK SERVER----

listen {port} {host} = address of the server, you connect to it with host:port

server_name {string} = the server name

errpage {path} = redirect to this page if we got an error (NGINX has another argument with is the status code, and the name of the attribute is "error_page". Do we change it ?)

max_filesize_upload (number) = limit the size of file the client can upload (NGINX accept the unit of the number, like "200M", and the name of the attribute is "client_max_body_size". Do we change it ?)

location {path} { = declare a new location block to allow route request to correct location, there may be several

---BLOCK LOCATION---

methods { = declare the allowed methods in this location block, there can be only one by location block

---BLOCK  METHODS---

GET {ON/OFF} = (allow or deny GET methods. Do we handle "on/off" (didn't find example of real config for this one) ?)
POST {ON/OFF}
DELETE {ON/OFF}

--------------------

return {number} {path} = used to rewrite URL, to redirect the HTTP. If the path is requested, we send the number response and we go to the new path

root {path} = change the location value above to this value, so it's from this path we will search files

directory_listing {ON/OFF} = enable or not directory listing. If we search for a directory in this location and it got a index (next attribute), it will display all the files in this directory on a page, else, we display an error

index {path} = index of the directory (if we search the directory, we display this page), for the attribute below.

##need to handle CGI

accept_uploaded_file {ON/OFF} = allow or not to upload file

save_uploaded_file {path} = where we save the file uploaded
--------------------

--------------------

##maybe there is some names that don't correspond to NGINX names
